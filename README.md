## Konosuba Judgment on this Greedy Game English Menu Patch for PC and Switch Proof of Concept
This patch adds a partial English menu and 5 machine translated scripts on PC and 3 on Switch.
###
We are looking for translators to translate the rest of the games' scripts, and will not be able to finish the patch without them because we do not want to machine translate the entire game.
###
If you wish to help please contact cheese#7058 or Shaggy_thecat#3572 on Discord.
## PC Patch Features
- Translated Menus and System text.
- A slighty modified font to fit more text on screen.
- Enabled Debug Menu. (Mostly broken)
- Changed the supported video container to .mp4 for Steam Deck / Linux compatability, and so one video file can be used for PS4, Switch, and PC.
## Switch Patch
- The Switch patch is a partial conversion of the PC patch and will have non-working options exposed.
- The "Game Over" button will call a debug function to trip all the flags in the game. (Spoilers!)
- The Debug Menu is not enabled.
- You will need to have a Switch with cfw to install the patch. Extract it to the root of your sd card.
## Where to buy the game
###
Windows: https://dlsoft.dmm.com/detail/images_0013/ 
- You need to use a vpn set to Japan to view and purchase the game due to the page being blocked outside of Japan.
###
Switch: https://store-jp.nintendo.com/list/software/70010000035750.html
- You will need a Japanese eshop account to purchase the game.
## Faq
### Do you plan to patch the Vita and PS4 versions?
If we get translators on borad to help with this project yes. Those versions of the game have various diffrences that we would need to make adjusments for due to diffrences in textures and the resolution on Vita.
### Why is this being released as is?
Because this project will go nowhere if it isn't. We had a translator but they have gone silent and the motivation for this project went with them. The work done here may help another team in the future if they wish to use this, if this project does not get completed.
### Do I need the game?
Yes, the files in releases are what's strictly needed for the patch.
## Disclamers
This project is not assoicated with or endorced by Kadokawa or MAGES./5pb.
