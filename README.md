# Konosuba Judgement on this Greedy Game English Menu Patch for PC and Switch Proof of Concept
This patch adds a partial English menu and machine translated tutorial and prolouge script. (Tutorial on Switch only)
###
We are looking for translators to translate the rest of the games' scripts, and will not be able to finish the game without them because we do not want to machine translate the entire game.

## PC Patch Features

- Changed the supported video container to .mp4 for Steam Deck / Linux compatability.
## Switch Patch Notes
- The Switch patch is a partail conversion of the PC patch and will have non-working options exposed.
- The "Game Over" button will call a debug feature trip all the flags in the game.
- You will need to have a Switch with cfw to install the patch. Extract it to the root of your sd card.
